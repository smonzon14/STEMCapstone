        <div class="message">Have you ever wanted to learn how to code? Don't know where to start or what you want to do with coding? You found the right place. As a graduating High-School student with a
            passion for coding and computer science, I have made countless projects and programs just from using the internet (which is much easier said than done). The problem with the internet is that it's HUGE. You can use places like
            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/all" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>, or <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> ($) to take
            courses, but what if you aren't ready to commit all of your precious time taking another course outside of school, when you could be playing Fortnite, Minecraft, or tossing a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football" target="_blank">pigskin</a> instead? Googling for hours on end is no fun (Although your fingers get pretty toned),
            so I have laid out a few projects that may be able to narrow down where your interests are. Hopefully you find one or two things that
            catch your eye, but if not, I won't be offended.</div>
        <div class="subtitle">Keep On Keepin' On</div>
        <div class="message">If you're like me, congratulations, you have stayed on this website long enough to read all of that gibberish, but don't stop now! The first and hardest lesson to
            learn how to code is learning how to READ. More often than not, I have overlooked information on websites I skim after double, even triple checking for the answers I search for. Hopefully this isn't going to be a waste
            of your time, so keep reading ;). Even if programming, learning how to make a website, hacking, making robots, 3D printing, or game making isn't on your itinerary or list of prospects, keep exploring -
            you might surprise yourself.</div>
